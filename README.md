- [ ] Create a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose the resource they are looking for

- [ ] Next to the dropdown menu, create an input field that accepts a number that will be used to query a specific id.

- [ ] Add a button to allow them to send a request to the API.

- [ ] On submission, navigate to the appropriate route and render at least 4 attributes for that specific resource.

- [ ] If the request is unsuccessful, create an error message that says "These aren't the droids you're looking for" with a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people", output the name of the character's homeworld (you may need to make another request)

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people" render a link to their homeworld (a specific planet). It's okay if the link text is simply "homeworld."

- [ ] NINJA BONUS: Add additional resources aside from people and planets to the dropdown.
